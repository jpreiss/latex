	abstract = {Soft robots are inherently safe and comply readily to their environment. They are therefore exciting for applications like search and rescue or medicine, which involve a high degree of uncertainty, and require interacting with humans. However, the best way to model and control soft robots largely remains an open question. One promising approach is to leverage physically-based modeling techniques such as the finite element method. However, such techniques are inherently limited by their physical assumptions. Indeed, real-world soft robots are often made from unpredictable materials, using imprecise techniques. Data-driven approaches provide an exciting alternative, as they can learn real-world fabrication defects and asymmetries. In this paper we present our first investigation into using machine learning to do soft robot control. We learn a differentiable model of a soft robot's quasi-static physics, and then perform gradient-based optimization to find optimal open-loop control inputs. We find that our learned model captures phenomena that would be absent from an idealized physically-based simulation. We also present practical techniques for acquiring high-quality motion capture data, and observations the effect of network complexity on model accuracy.},

	abstract = {Efficient and tractable dynamics models of soft robots are needed for many purposes. For soft robots powered by shape memory actuators, models must simultaneously capture actuator dynamics alongside material deformations. This article examines one possible modeling framework using Gaussian Process (GP) regression, applied in two settings. First, we attempt predictions of bending deformation in a low-dimensional hardware task of a single limb with one shape memory alloy (SMA) actuator, where the SMA temperature is estimated in open loop. Second, we consider locomotion in a simulation of a rolling robot, where the actuator state is known perfectly but the state space is high-dimensional and hybrid. Our locomotion tests examine the applicability of standard model selection choices for a GP, particularly the commonly-used squared exponential (SE) kernel, by studying the hyperparameter optimization problem. We cross-validate one-step-ahead dynamics predictions for both robots. All results have significant noise, but for the single limb in bending, the GP predictions are sufficient to simulate motions over a time horizon of 30 seconds. With further work to address issues with data quality, underfitting, and other sources of error, these dynamics models have the potential to assist in trajectory generation and control for soft robots.},

	abstract = {A broad class of engineering problems including penetration, impact and large rotations of solid bodies causes severe numerical problems. For these problems, the constitutive equations are history dependent so material points must be followed; this is difficult to implement in a Eulerian scheme. On the other hand, purely Lagrangian methods typically result in severe mesh distortion and the consequence is ill conditioning of the element stiffness matrix leading to mesh lockup or entanglement. Remeshing prevents the lockup and tangling but then interpolation must be performed for history dependent variables, a process which can introduce errors. Proposed here is an extension of the particle-in-cell method in which particles are interpreted to be material points that are followed through the complete loading process. A fixed Eulerian grid provides the means for determining a spatial gradient. Because the grid can also be interpreted as an updated Lagrangian frame, the usual convection term in the acceleration associated with Eulerian formulations does not appear. With the use of maps between material points and the grid, the advantages of both Eulerian and Lagrangian schemes are utilized so that mesh tangling is avoided while material variables are tracked through the complete deformation history. Example solutions in two dimensions are given to illustrate the robustness of the proposed convection algorithm and to show that typical elastic behavior can be reproduced. Also, it is shown that impact with no slip is handled without any special algorithm for bodies governed by elasticity and strain hardening plasticity.},
