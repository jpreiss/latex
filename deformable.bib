	abstract = {Due to their complex dynamics and high-dimensional configuration spaces, non-rigid objects such as cables, garments, bedding and various food items remain notoriously challenging for robots to manipulate effectively. In this letter, we therefore develop, validate and analyze model-based optimal control techniques for dynamic manipulation of deformable objects. We study, in particular, the application of both the batch Newton method and the stagewise Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) approach to this challenging problem domain. On a technical level, we derive analytic formulations for all necessary derivatives, noting that numerically stable simulation of deformable objects demands implicit integration schemes, which do not have closed form solutions. While both DDP and Newton's method converge quadratically, our experiments and analysis show that the relative overall performance of these two approaches depends heavily on the dimensions of the control problems being solved. We demonstrate the efficacy of our trajectory optimization formulations through a variety of simulation and real-world experiments.},

The key contribution of this paper is to formulate the task as a multiarmed bandit problem, with each arm representing a model of the deformable object. To “pull” an arm and evaluate its utility, we use the arm's model to generate a velocity command for the gripper(s) holding the object and execute it. As the task proceeds and the object deforms, the utility of each model can change. Our framework estimates these changes and balances the exploration of the model set with exploitation of high-utility models. We also propose an approach based on Kalman filtering for nonstationary multiarmed normal bandits to leverage the coupling between the models to learn more from each arm pull. We demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods on synthetic trials and performs competitively on several manipulation tasks in simulation.},

	abstract = {We present a framework for deformable object manipulation that interleaves planning and control, enabling complex manipulation tasks without relying on high-fidelity modeling or simulation. The key question we address is when should we use planning and when should we use control to achieve the task? Planners are designed to find paths through complex configuration spaces, but for highly underactuated systems, such as deformable objects, achieving a specific configuration is very difficult even with high-fidelity models. Conversely, controllers can be designed to achieve specific configurations, but they can be trapped in undesirable local minima owing to obstacles. Our approach consists of three components: (1) a global motion planner to generate gross motion of the deformable object; (2) a local controller for refinement of the configuration of the deformable object; and (3) a novel deadlock prediction algorithm to determine when to use planning versus control. By separating planning from control we are able to use different representations of the deformable object, reducing overall complexity and enabling efficient computation of motion. We provide a detailed proof of probabilistic completeness for our planner, which is valid despite the fact that our system is underactuated and we do not have a steering function. We then demonstrate that our framework is able to successfully perform several manipulation tasks with rope and cloth in simulation, which cannot be performed using either our controller or planner alone. These experiments suggest that our planner can generate paths efficiently, taking under a second on average to find a feasible path in three out of four scenarios. We also show that our framework is effective on a 16-degree-of-freedom physical robot, where reachability and dual-arm constraints make the planning more difficult.},

	abstract = {Soft robots are inherently safe and comply readily to their environment. They are therefore exciting for applications like search and rescue or medicine, which involve a high degree of uncertainty, and require interacting with humans. However, the best way to model and control soft robots largely remains an open question. One promising approach is to leverage physically-based modeling techniques such as the finite element method. However, such techniques are inherently limited by their physical assumptions. Indeed, real-world soft robots are often made from unpredictable materials, using imprecise techniques. Data-driven approaches provide an exciting alternative, as they can learn real-world fabrication defects and asymmetries. In this paper we present our first investigation into using machine learning to do soft robot control. We learn a differentiable model of a soft robot's quasi-static physics, and then perform gradient-based optimization to find optimal open-loop control inputs. We find that our learned model captures phenomena that would be absent from an idealized physically-based simulation. We also present practical techniques for acquiring high-quality motion capture data, and observations the effect of network complexity on model accuracy.},

	abstract = {Efficient and tractable dynamics models of soft robots are needed for many purposes. For soft robots powered by shape memory actuators, models must simultaneously capture actuator dynamics alongside material deformations. This article examines one possible modeling framework using Gaussian Process (GP) regression, applied in two settings. First, we attempt predictions of bending deformation in a low-dimensional hardware task of a single limb with one shape memory alloy (SMA) actuator, where the SMA temperature is estimated in open loop. Second, we consider locomotion in a simulation of a rolling robot, where the actuator state is known perfectly but the state space is high-dimensional and hybrid. Our locomotion tests examine the applicability of standard model selection choices for a GP, particularly the commonly-used squared exponential (SE) kernel, by studying the hyperparameter optimization problem. We cross-validate one-step-ahead dynamics predictions for both robots. All results have significant noise, but for the single limb in bending, the GP predictions are sufficient to simulate motions over a time horizon of 30 seconds. With further work to address issues with data quality, underfitting, and other sources of error, these dynamics models have the potential to assist in trajectory generation and control for soft robots.},

However, accurately modeling soft robot dynamics in order to do model-based control is extremely time consuming and difficult. neural networks are a powerful tool for modeling systems with complex dynamics such as an inflatable robot link with antagonistic pneumatic actuation. Unfortunately it is also difficult to apply standard model-based control techniques using a neural net. In this work, we show that the gradients used within a neural net to relate system states and inputs to outputs can be used to formulate a linearized discrete state space representation of the system. Using the state space representation, model predictive control can be developed with a one degree of freedom soft robot to achieve position control within 2° of the commanded joint angle. Additionally, control using the model derived from the neural net has similar performance to control using a model derived from first principles that took significantly longer to develop. This shows the potential of combining empirical modeling approaches with model-based control for soft robots.},

In this paper, we present a model-based policy learning algorithm for closed-loop predictive control of a soft robotic manipulator. The forward dynamic model is represented using a recurrent neural network. The closed-loop policy is derived using trajectory optimization and supervised learning. The approach is verified first on a simulated piecewise constant strain model of a cable driven under-actuated soft manipulator. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate on a soft pneumatically actuated manipulator how closed-loop control policies can be derived that can accommodate variable frequency control and unmodeled external loads.},

Koopman Operator Theory offers a way to construct explicit linear dynamical models of soft robots and to control them using established model-based linear control methods. This method is data-driven, yet unlike other data-driven models such as neural networks, it yields an explicit control-oriented linear model rather than just a "black-box" input-output mapping. This work describes this Koopman-based system identification method and its application to model predictive controller design. A model and MPC controller of a pneumatic soft robot arm was constructed via the method, and its performance was evaluated over several trajectory following tasks in the real-world. On all of the tasks, the Koopman-based MPC controller outperformed a benchmark MPC controller based on a linear state-space model of the same system.},

	abstract = {A broad class of engineering problems including penetration, impact and large rotations of solid bodies causes severe numerical problems. For these problems, the constitutive equations are history dependent so material points must be followed; this is difficult to implement in a Eulerian scheme. On the other hand, purely Lagrangian methods typically result in severe mesh distortion and the consequence is ill conditioning of the element stiffness matrix leading to mesh lockup or entanglement. Remeshing prevents the lockup and tangling but then interpolation must be performed for history dependent variables, a process which can introduce errors. Proposed here is an extension of the particle-in-cell method in which particles are interpreted to be material points that are followed through the complete loading process. A fixed Eulerian grid provides the means for determining a spatial gradient. Because the grid can also be interpreted as an updated Lagrangian frame, the usual convection term in the acceleration associated with Eulerian formulations does not appear. With the use of maps between material points and the grid, the advantages of both Eulerian and Lagrangian schemes are utilized so that mesh tangling is avoided while material variables are tracked through the complete deformation history. Example solutions in two dimensions are given to illustrate the robustness of the proposed convection algorithm and to show that typical elastic behavior can be reproduced. Also, it is shown that impact with no slip is handled without any special algorithm for bodies governed by elasticity and strain hardening plasticity.},

The text develops around a core of consistent and rigorous formalism with fundamental and technological material giving rise naturally and with gradually increasing difficulty to more advanced considerations.The theory of manipulator structures presented in the early part of the book encompasses:• the fundamentals: kinematics, statics and trajectory planning; and• the technology of actuators, sensors and control units.Subsequently, more advanced instruction is given in:• dynamics and motion control of robot manipulators;• environmental interaction using exteroceptive sensory data (force and vision);• mobile robots; and• motion planning.® code for computer problems; these are available free of charge to those adopting Robotics as a textbook for courses. This text is suitable for use in senior undergraduate and graduate courses in automation and computer, electrical, electronic and mechanical engineering courses with strong robotics content.},

	abstract = {Finite element methods have become ever more important to engineers as tools for design and optimization, now even for solving non-linear technological problems. However, several aspects must be considered for finite-element simulations which are specific for non-linear problems: These problems require the knowledge and the understanding of theoretical foundations and their finite-element discretization as well as algorithms for solving the non-linear equations. This book provides the reader with the required knowledge covering the complete field of finite element analyses in solid mechanics. It is written for advanced students in engineering fields but serves also as an introduction into non-linear simulation for the practising engineer.},
